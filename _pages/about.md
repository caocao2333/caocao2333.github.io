I am a current undergraduate student at the University of Rochester, majoring in Computer Science with Honor in Research and a minot in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I am interested in the intersection of computer science and electrical engineering, particularly in the areas of ML-Systems, computer architecture, and hardware-software co-design. Currently, I am a research assistant at the Department of Computer Science, working on a project that aims to improve the performance of LLM inference on heterogeneous systems. In particular, I am working on developing a hardware-software co-design framework that can optimize the performance of LLM inference on devices with different hardware accelerators, such as GPUs, matrix processors among others. I am also a teaching assistant for the course _CSC252: Computer Organization_ at the University of Rochester.
